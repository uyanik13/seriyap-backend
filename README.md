## Laravel Backend API Project - Not Completed
This is a Laravel project for building a RESTful API backend. It includes JWT authentication for secure user authentication.

Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine.
```
Copy .env.example to .env and update the database credentials.
Run composer install to install the project dependencies.
Run php artisan migrate to create the database tables.
Run php artisan db:seed to seed the database with test data (optional).
Run php artisan jwt:secret to generate the JWT secret key.
Run php artisan serve to start the server.
```
Endpoints
The following endpoints are available:

POST /api/auth/login - Authenticate user and return a JWT token.
POST /api/auth/register - Create a new user account.
GET /api/auth/logout - Logout user and invalidate JWT token.
GET /api/users - Get a list of all users (requires authentication).
GET /api/users/{id} - Get a single user by ID (requires authentication).
PUT /api/users/{id} - Update a user by ID (requires authentication).
DELETE /api/users/{id} - Delete a user by ID (requires authentication).
Security
This project uses JWT authentication for secure user authentication. JWT tokens are generated on successful login and returned to the client. The client must include the JWT token in the Authorization header of subsequent requests to access protected endpoints. The server validates the JWT token and returns a 401 Unauthorized response if the token is invalid or expired.
